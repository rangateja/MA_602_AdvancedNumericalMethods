# MA_602_AdvancedNumericalMethods
Matlab codes for various Numerical techniques
These are the couple of functions which can be used for problems on Numerical methods
these repistory contain the code for solving linear systems using LU decomposition ( namely: Doolittle, Cholesky) and iterative schemes like Gauss Seidel, Jacobian)
it also contain the method to find a interpolating polynomial fitting using Newton forward interpolation with Chebschev interpolating points.
